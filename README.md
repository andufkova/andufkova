### Hello world 👋
<!--
I'm Aneta and I speak Czech, English, French, a bit of Italian, Python, C, SQL, JavaScript ... 

My very first language was PHP (elementary school), then I discoverd OOP with Java (high school). During my years at university, I had the opportunity to write projects in many languages (including R, Java, C++, Haskell or Prolog), but I particularly liked Python. So if you ask me today what my favourite language is, it's Python. Along with French, of course.
